The instrumentation code is inserted by modifying the abstract syntax tree that the compiler produces from the user's source text. But, like most literary plots moved into opera, the libretto departs creatively from its source text. The programs are sorted by the number of lines of source text.
Note that no examples of a preceding /s/ occur in the source text. Translators are often involved in the task of choosing suitable target lexical units that correspond with those that are in the source text.
There is also a tacit presumption that the purpose for which summaries are used is for guidance on the source text.
